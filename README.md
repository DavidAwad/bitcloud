# Bitcloud

This is a flask web app that mines bitcoins in the cloud !

Its mining software runs in python, so it's nno fst, it's mostly just a cool proof of concept. 

The fun part of this is that you can actually see the bitcoins being mined!

It also uses the sendgrid api for the email sharing the app to other people.

Please enjoy the interface! I love it.
