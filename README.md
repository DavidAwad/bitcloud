# Bitcloud

This is a flask web app that mines bitcoins in the cloud !

It uses a SQLite database to store the name and the person who comes up with the nickname.

It also uses sendgrid for the email sharing.

It currently works and I'll be hosting it on digitalocean in the near future. 

So i've been working on getting the hosing to work, if you currently go to [basildb.me](basildb.me) you will find a directory. So please if you have experience wih hosting flask apps on digital ocean send me an email as it seems this is an apache2 problem. 


Please enjoy the wonderful UX/UI. (I'm in love with it!)

If you want to make pull requests please send me an email first describing your changes first and preferably a link to a runnable.com host of it. Thanks!
